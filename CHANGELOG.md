### Changed

-   Use snapshot testing plugin (syrupy) for component rendering tests instead of HTML fixtures
-   form.helper (`FormHelper`) changed from a static `@property` to the form's `__init__` method to allow changes at runtime

-   `BaseForm` renamed to `TbxFormsMixin` to more accurately convey what it is
-   Styles no longer depend on the form having the `.tbxforms` class

### Fixed

-   `DateInputField` with `required=False` no longer raises a `ValueError` when no values are passed
-   `DateInputField` no longer errors with `OverflowError` when large values are passed
