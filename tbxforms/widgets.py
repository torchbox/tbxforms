    A DateInputWidget defines the styling of the set of fields for displaying
    the value for a DateInputField.

    A custom widget was needed for two reasons. First the CSS classes
    needed to style the fields and set their width reduces the code
    need to add a Date input component to a form. Second, the Design
    System requires labels for the individual fields. That's not
    supported out of the box by a MultiValueField so the labels are
    added as a custom attribute and rendered with the correct markup
    in the template. The template also pops the label from the widget
    so it does not also get added as an attribute.
